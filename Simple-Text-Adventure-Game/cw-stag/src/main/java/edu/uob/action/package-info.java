/**
 * All commands (including entity names, locations, built-in commands and action triggers) should be treated as case-insensitive.<br>
 * Built-in commands are reserved words and therefore cannot be used as names for any other elements of the command language.<br>
 * Note that trigger phrases cannot (and will not) contain the names of entities, since this would make incoming commands far too difficult to interpret. Just consider the challenge of trying to interpret the command: `lock lock with key`.<br>
